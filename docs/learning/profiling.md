# Profiling

Profiling is the skill and art of finding which part of your code needs the most time, and therefore to find the place where you can (should, need to) optimize (first). The optimization can be different things, like using library functions instead of self-written ones, re-arranging memory access, removing function calls, writing C/Fortran functions for your Python code.

The profiling can be done manually by adding time and print statements to your code or (better) by using tools like Valgrind, TAU, HPCToolkit, Score-P or Python's Scalene or cProfile.

Tools to profile applications and perform efficiency, scaling and energy analysis are described in this document by the Virtual Institute High Performance Computing: [https://www.vi-hps.org/cms/upload/material/general/ToolsGuide.pdf](https://www.vi-hps.org/cms/upload/material/general/ToolsGuide.pdf)

## Monitoring jobs on the node

It is possible to submit a second (this time) interactive job to the node where the main job is running, check with `squeue` where your job is running, then submit

```sh
srun -w <nodename> --pty htop
```

Note that there must be free slots on the machine, so you cannot use `-n 80` or `--exclusive` for your main job (use `-n 78`).

Alternative method if you have X11, e.g. on Linux computers:

When you login to base, use `ssh -X -Y UniID@base.hpc.taltech.ee`,

then submit your main job with `srun --x11 -n <numtasks> --cpus-per-task=<numthreads> --pty bash` and start an `xterm -e htop &` in the session.

In `sbatch` the option `--x11=batch` can be used, note that the ssh session to base needs to stay open!

## Valgrind

Manual: [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual.html](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual.html)

Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

The Valgrind distribution currently includes seven production-quality tools: a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler, and two different heap profilers. It also includes an experimental SimPoint basic block vector generator.

## Profiling Python

Python is *very* slow, the best improvement is achieved by rewriting (parts of) the program in Fortran or C. See also "Python Performance Matters" by Emery Berger (Strange Loop 2022) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVUnCXKuNOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVUnCXKuNOg)

### Python Scalene

Scalene is a CPU, GPU and memory profiler for Python that is very performant (introduces very little overhead).

Installation: load your favourite Python module, e.g.

```sh
module load green-spack
module load python/3.8.7-gcc-10.3.0-plhb
py-pip/21.1.2-gcc-10.3.0-python-3.8.7-bj7d
```

then install using pip:

```sh
python -m pip install --user scalene
```

Homepage and quickstart: [https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene](https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene)

### Python cProfile

## perf

[https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page)

perf is powerful: it can instrument CPU performance counters, tracepoints, kprobes, and uprobes (dynamic tracing). It is capable of lightweight profiling. It is also included in the Linux kernel, under tools/perf, and is frequently updated and enhanced.

perf began as a tool for using the performance counters subsystem in Linux, and has had various enhancements to add tracing capabilities.

## TAU, Jumpshot, Paraprof

TAU can be used for *profiling* and for *MPI tracing* (not at the same time, though). See e.g. <https://wiki.mpich.org/mpich/index.php/TAU_by_example>

Load the spack TAU module:

```sh
module load green-spack
module load tau/2.30.2-gcc-10.3.0-2wge
```

**Profiling**

TAU supports different methods of instrumentation:

- Dynamic: statistical sampling of a binary through preloading of libraries
- Source: parser-aided automatic instrumentation at compile time
- Selective: a subcategory of source, it is automatic, but guided source code instrumentation

The simplest and only for existing binary software is dynamic profiling through `tau_exec`, just run

```sh
srun tau_exec your_program
```

several `profile.*` files will be created. This method can unfortunately only profile MPI functions and not user-defined ones. Note, that profile files are only generated if the program exits normally, not if an error occurs or SLURM kills it!

You can generate reports with `pprof` and visualize with `paraprof`.

**MPI tracing**

The tracing can take a lot of space, it is not uncommon that tracefiles are several GB in size for each MPI-task!

```sh
export TAU_TRACE=1
srun  -n 2 tau_exec ./pingpong-lg-mpi4
tau_treemerge.pl
```

TAU does not have a tracing visualizer, but provides tools to convert its traces to other formats, e.g. slog2 for jumpshot, otf(2) or paraver:

```sh
tau2slog2 tau.trc tau.edf -o tau.slog2
tau_convert -paraver tau.trc tau.edf trace.prv
```

The traces can be visualized using `jumpshot` (in the tau module), just run

```sh
jumpshot tau.slog2
```

jumpshot may open a huge window (larger than screen size), in this case use the "maximize" option of your window manager (fvwm: in the left window corner menu), jumpshot opens 3 windows: "jumpshot-4", "Legend" and "Timeline" (if you cannot find them, use window manager menu, e.g. fvwm: right mouse button on desktop background).

## EZTrace + ViTE

[EZTrace 1.1](https://eztrace.gitlab.io/eztrace/eztrace-1/tutorials/tutorial_mpi/) and [ViTE 1.2](https://eztrace.gitlab.io/eztrace/eztrace-1/tutorials/tutorial_mpi/) are installed on **amp** and **viz**.

EZTrace is a tool to analyze event traces, it has several modules:

- stdio: Module for stdio functions (read, write, select, poll, etc.)
- starpu: module for StarPU framework
- pthread: Module for PThread synchronization functions (mutex, semaphore, spinlock, etc.)
- papi: Module for PAPI Performance counters
- openmpi: Module for MPI functions
- memory: Module for memory functions (malloc, free, etc.)

ViTE is the visualization tool to visualize the generated traces, it can visualize also .otf2 traces obtained from other MPI tracing tools (e.g. converted from TAU)

## HPCToolkit

Load modules

```sh
module load hpctoolkit
```

run application with binary instrumentation

```sh
srun -n 2 -p green-ib hpcrun <your_application>
hpcstruct `which <your_application>`
hpcprof hpctoolkit-<your_application>-measurements-<PID>
```

run GUI tool for interpretation

```sh
hpcviewer hpctoolkit-<your_application>-database-<PID>
```

starts `hpcviewer` and opens the database.

---

## Paraver trace visualizer

Load the module

```sh
module load green
module load Paraver
```

start paraver

```sh
wxparaver
```

then load the .prv trace file

---

## Extrae

---

## Score-P

Scalable Performance Measurement Infrastructure for Parallel Codes

```sh
module load green-spack
module load scorep
```

The module with hash "mlw5" contains the PDT instrumenter. The module with hash "o4v3" contains the PDT instrumenter and libunwind.

[Score-P Quickstart](https://scorepci.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/scorep-pipelines/docs/scorep-4.1/html/quickstart.html)

compilation: prefix the compiler command with "scorep", e.g. `scorep gcc ...` or `scorep mpicc ...`, this can also be used in Makefiles:

```makefile
MPICC = $(PREP) mpicc
```

(and analogously for linkers and other compilers). One can then use the same makefile to either build an instrumented version with the

```sh
make PREP="scorep"
```

a simple `make` will generate an uninstrumented binary.

The environment variables SCOREP_ENABLE_TRACING and SCOREP_ENABLE_PROFILING control whether event trace data or profiles are stored in this directory. By setting either variable to true, the corresponding data will be written to the directory. The default values are true for SCOREP_ENABLE_PROFILING and false for SCOREP_ENABLE_TRACING.
